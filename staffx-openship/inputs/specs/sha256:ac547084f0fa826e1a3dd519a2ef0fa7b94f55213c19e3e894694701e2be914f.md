Auth0 is used as the identity provider. Configure an Auth0 tenant with: (1) Database connection for email/password, (2) Google social connection, (3) GitHub social connection. The backend validates JWT access tokens issued by Auth0. The frontends use Auth0 SPA SDK (@auth0/auth0-react) to initiate login flows and obtain tokens.
