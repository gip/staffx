When maintaining architecture state, preserve typed node IDs, ownership and boundary metadata, and host naming conventions. Keep Features and General Specs documents present for every node. Keep API interface documentation synchronized with registered route surfaces. Validate all matrix document references resolve to existing hashes. Keep summary and docs artifacts per node updated after major behavior changes. Treat dormant modules as out-of-runtime unless bootstrap registration changes.
