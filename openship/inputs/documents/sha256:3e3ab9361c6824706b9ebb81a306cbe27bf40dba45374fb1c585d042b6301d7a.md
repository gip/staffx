This root node defines the canonical OpenShip concern matrix for the system. Rebuild scope includes monorepo workspace orchestration, runtime separation between desktop/web/API, shared package reuse boundaries, and third-party service integrations. Out-of-runtime modules are documented explicitly and excluded from rebuild-critical execution paths.
