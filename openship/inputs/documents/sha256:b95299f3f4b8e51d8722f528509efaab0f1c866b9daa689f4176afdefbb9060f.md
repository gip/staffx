# StaffX Feature Index

This index enumerates the implemented feature surfaces and maps them to the execution architecture.

## Feature set
- Authentication and identity federation for web and desktop clients.
- Project lifecycle management including creation, naming validation, settings, visibility, and archive.
- Collaboration management including project collaborators, custom project roles, and concern registry maintenance.
- Thread lifecycle management including clone-based creation, detail views, metadata updates, and finalization statuses.
- Topology and matrix visualization with persisted node layout coordinates.
- Assistant run orchestration with queue, claim, completion, and cancellation.
- Event delivery with both polling and SSE streaming semantics.
- External integrations for Notion and Google OAuth and document import prerequisites.
- OpenShip export and reconciliation pipeline for documentation-driven system updates.

## Client surfaces
- Web client: apps/web/src/main.tsx and apps/web/src/app.tsx.
- Desktop client renderer and shell: apps/desktop/src/renderer/app.tsx, apps/desktop/src/main/index.ts, and preload bridge.
- Shared UI component system: packages/ui/src.

## Backend surfaces
- Fastify bootstrap and mounted route topology: apps/api/src/index.ts.
- Active v1 contracts: apps/api/src/routes/v1.ts with mounted supporting route files.
- Auth bootstrap: apps/api/src/auth.ts.
- Integration providers and token encryption: apps/api/src/integrations.
- Assistant queue and OpenShip orchestration: apps/api/src/agent-queue.ts, apps/api/src/agent-runner.ts, apps/api/src/openship-sync.ts.

## Rebuild checkpoint
- A rebuild is successful when all indexed features can be executed through their documented contracts with consistent data model behavior and event stream semantics.
