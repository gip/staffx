Main process interfaces include IPC handlers for auth state, auth token retrieval, login/logout actions, and assistant run invocation. It integrates with backend assistant-run claim and completion endpoints, writes OpenShip bundle files to local workspace directories, and uses @staffx/agent-runtime for execution and bundle diffing. Failure behavior is returned as structured run errors to renderer.
