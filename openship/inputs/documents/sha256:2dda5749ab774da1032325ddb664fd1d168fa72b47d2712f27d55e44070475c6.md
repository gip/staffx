Authentication is bearer-token based and delegated to Auth0. API verifies JWT issuer/audience and JWKS signatures, then maps or creates user records. Authorization is role-aware at project and thread levels: Owner, Editor, and Viewer capabilities are enforced server-side. Sensitive integration tokens are encrypted at rest using configured encryption keys. Desktop renderer has no direct Node access and relies on context-isolated preload IPC. OAuth callbacks sanitize return targets and enforce provider validation. Event and thread access checks are performed before returning run or state data.
