The API process is authoritative for access control, snapshot lifecycle, and database writes. It validates UUID and project-thread identifiers, supports both direct and plan run modes, reconciles OpenShip bundle payloads, and emits event records for status changes. Dormant legacy route modules are excluded from active registration and documented separately as out-of-runtime.
