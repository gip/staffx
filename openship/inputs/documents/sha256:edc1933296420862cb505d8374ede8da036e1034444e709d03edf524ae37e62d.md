title: Out-of-Runtime Modules and Scope Boundaries
language: en
---

Scope boundary note for active runtime documentation.

Included scope:
- Only route modules registered in the current API bootstrap are considered active.
- All node, edge, feature, and spec documents describe behavior reachable in the active runtime path.

Excluded scope:
- Route modules present in source but not registered by API bootstrap are explicitly out-of-runtime for this bundle.
- Specifically, legacy route files for projects and threads that are not wired by current bootstrap should not be treated as active contract surfaces.

Why this boundary matters:
- Rebuild projects should prioritize active routes and data paths to avoid implementing stale behaviors.
- Documentation consumers should treat excluded modules as historical references only.

Rebuild usage guidance:
1. Validate API registration graph first, then document endpoint inventory from registered modules only.
2. Preserve out-of-runtime annotation in future bundle updates to avoid accidental contract drift.
3. If excluded modules are re-enabled later, update endpoint and side-effect documentation in the next as-built revision.
