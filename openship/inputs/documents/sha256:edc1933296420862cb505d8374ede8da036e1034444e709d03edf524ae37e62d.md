This bundle covers only active runtime modules registered by the current server bootstrap and client entrypoints. In API routes, apps/api/src/routes/projects.ts and apps/api/src/routes/thread.ts exist but are not registered in apps/api/src/index.ts for active /v1 runtime handling. The as-built documentation excludes dormant route modules from rebuild-critical flow definitions and treats them as non-executed implementation residue.
