Renderer process consumes preload-exposed IPC APIs and backend v1 HTTP APIs. It runs with HashRouter navigation and shares UI components with web through @staffx/ui. It streams events via SSE with polling fallback, persists local UI state, and applies run results to thread state with deterministic merge behavior.
