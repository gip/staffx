title: Specs - Desktop Renderer Process
language: en
---

This technical specification defines rebuild-critical implementation constraints for Desktop Renderer Process. The intent is to allow a new team to recreate equivalent runtime behavior from documents alone.

Node identity and boundary:
- Node ID: p.desktop-renderer.
- Kind: Process.
- Parent: Desktop Runtime.
- Ownership model: first_party.
- Trust boundary: external.
- Metadata runtime: react/electron-renderer.

Interface and connectivity contract:
- Inbound dependency count: 1.
- Outbound dependency count: 3.
- Inbound contracts:
  Runtime flow from Desktop Main Process using transport electron-ipc and application semantics ipc-request-response.
- Outbound contracts:
  Runtime flow to API Service Process using transport https and application semantics rest-json.
  Runtime flow to Desktop Main Process using transport electron-ipc and application semantics ipc-command.
  Dependency flow to @staffx/ui Shared UI Library using transport unspecified protocol and application semantics unspecified application protocol.

Operational specification:
- Startup order must satisfy inbound dependency readiness before serving or consuming traffic.
- Shutdown order must drain in-flight work where possible and close external connections cleanly.
- Configuration must be environment-driven, with explicit defaults only where safe for local development.
- Security controls must enforce least privilege for tokens, credentials, and network paths crossing boundaries.

Rebuild procedure for this node:
1. Recreate containment location and parent relationship in the topology graph.
2. Re-establish all inbound and outbound edge contracts, including protocol and layer7 semantics.
3. Restore concern-matrix linked documents and skills before enabling write paths.
4. Validate behavior against node-specific feature expectations and shared integration contracts.
5. Record evidence of successful startup, interface validation, and failure recovery checks.
