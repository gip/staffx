# Thread Lifecycle and Timeline

## Purpose
Track collaborative architecture change sessions as immutable timeline actions over system snapshots.

## Capabilities
- List and fetch thread details by UUID or project thread index.
- Clone new threads from latest or explicit source thread.
- Update title, description, and status.
- Delete thread and dependent timeline records.

## Workflow
- New thread creation uses clone_thread SQL function with next project_thread_id.
- Thread detail endpoint resolves current system through thread_current_system function.
- Timeline data combines actions, messages, and optional run metadata labels.

## Status model
- open allows edits and assistant runs.
- closed and committed are finalized statuses.

## Data touched
- threads
- actions
- messages
- systems and OpenShip-linked tables via current system resolution

## Failure modes
- Numeric thread route ids can be ambiguous across projects without projectId query.
- Missing source thread prevents clone creation.
- Unauthorized edits blocked for Viewer role.

## Source traceability
