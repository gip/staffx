StaffX records ordered event entries for assistant run lifecycle and thread matrix changes. Clients consume events via cursor-based polling or SSE stream endpoints. Cursor semantics support replay and resume from last received event identifier. Event payloads include aggregate metadata, trace identifiers, and version fields so clients can reconcile UI state deterministically. SSE emits heartbeat comments and retry hints while polling provides resilient fallback for restricted environments.
