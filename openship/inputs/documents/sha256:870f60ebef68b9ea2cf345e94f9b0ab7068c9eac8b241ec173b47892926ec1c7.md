To rebuild StaffX, prepare Node.js 20+ and pnpm 9 workspace tooling, provision PostgreSQL, and supply Auth0 plus optional Notion/Google integration credentials. Bootstrap flow is: install dependencies; run database migration; configure API, web, and desktop environments; start API service; start web and/or desktop clients; verify authenticated access and thread operations. Assistant execution requires agent SDK credentials and optional runner enablement flags. Desktop direct mode requires writable local workspace path and backend connectivity for run claim/complete endpoints. Rebuild validation should confirm project creation, thread fetch/update, matrix layout persistence, assistant run lifecycle, and event stream delivery.
