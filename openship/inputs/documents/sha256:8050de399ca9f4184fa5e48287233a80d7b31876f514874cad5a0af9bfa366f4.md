title: Features - Desktop Main Process
language: en
---

This feature specification describes the active runtime responsibilities for Desktop Main Process. It is written as an as-built artifact and should be treated as the source of truth for rebuild decisions at node scope.

Primary responsibilities:
- Owns Process scope within the runtime graph and participates in concern matrix execution boundaries.
- Maintains ownership=first_party and boundary=external governance expectations for this node.
- Serves as a rebuild checkpoint: if this node is unavailable or misconfigured, dependent nodes should be considered unstable.

Containment and topology context:
- Parent node: Desktop Runtime.
- Child nodes: none.
- Outbound edges: 4. Inbound edges: 1.
- Runtime flow to API Service Process using transport https and application semantics rest-json.
- Runtime flow to Desktop Renderer Process using transport electron-ipc and application semantics ipc-request-response.
- Runtime flow to Auth0 Identity Process using transport https and application semantics oidc-oauth2-pkce.
- Dependency flow to @staffx/agent-runtime Execution Library using transport unspecified protocol and application semantics unspecified application protocol.
- Runtime flow from Desktop Renderer Process using transport electron-ipc and application semantics ipc-command.

Runtime behavior commitments:
- Behavior must remain deterministic for authenticated requests and idempotent where retried by clients, workers, or orchestration loops.
- Failure handling must preserve data integrity before availability; partial writes are considered defects unless explicitly modeled as compensating actions.
- Event publication and polling consistency must preserve client replay semantics where applicable.

Rebuild acceptance checkpoints:
1. Node can be started with environment prerequisites and connects to all declared dependencies.
2. All declared interfaces for this node are reachable and return expected status and payload shape.
3. Observability paths (health checks, logs, and event traces) provide enough signal to diagnose startup and runtime faults.
4. Node failure can be isolated without corrupting shared data or global state.
5. Recovery path is documented and executable by operators without reading source code.
