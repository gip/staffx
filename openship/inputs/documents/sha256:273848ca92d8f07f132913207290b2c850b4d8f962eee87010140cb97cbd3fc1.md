# Inactive Legacy API Modules

The active API bootstrap in apps/api/src/index.ts does not mount apps/api/src/routes/projects.ts or apps/api/src/routes/thread.ts.

## Current status
- apps/api/src/routes/projects.ts: present in source tree but inactive in current mounted runtime.
- apps/api/src/routes/thread.ts: present in source tree but inactive in current mounted runtime.

## Implication for rebuild
- Rebuild and contract validation must target mounted route modules only.
- Legacy modules can be treated as historical reference or migration context and should not be exposed as active API surface unless bootstrap registration is intentionally changed.
