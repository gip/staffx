# Functional Testing and Validation Strategy

## Validation goals
- Ensure all documented endpoint contracts match active mounted behavior.
- Ensure OpenShip directory content validates against OpenShip v1 structural expectations.
- Ensure role-based authorization boundaries prevent unauthorized mutation.

## Recommended checks
- Start API and execute endpoint smoke tests for each route group.
- Verify project creation creates initial system and thread records.
- Verify thread matrix patch updates node layout and emits matrix change event.
- Verify run start, claim, completion, and cancellation state transitions.
- Verify event polling and SSE replay behavior with cursor continuity.
- Verify integration callback and status transitions using test credentials.

## OpenShip bundle quality checks
- Confirm each input document filename matches canonical hash and front matter hash.
- Confirm all matrix refs resolve to existing input docs or skills.
- Confirm one root node and valid edge endpoint constraints.
- Confirm no Code artifacts are present in this docs-only bundle.
