Runtime connectivity is organized around client-to-API HTTPS calls, API-to-database PG wire transport, API-to-identity OAuth/OIDC exchanges, and API-to-integration provider REST calls. Desktop adds an IPC boundary between renderer and main processes. Dependency relationships are explicit from runtime processes to shared libraries, especially @staffx/ui for presentation contracts and @staffx/agent-runtime for execution and OpenShip diff utilities.
