title: Specs - Auth0
language: en
---

This technical specification defines rebuild-critical implementation constraints for Auth0. The intent is to allow a new team to recreate equivalent runtime behavior from documents alone.

Node identity and boundary:
- Node ID: h.auth0.
- Kind: Host.
- Parent: StaffX Active Runtime.
- Ownership model: third_party.
- Trust boundary: external.
- Metadata platform: auth0-cloud.

Interface and connectivity contract:
- Inbound dependency count: 0.
- Outbound dependency count: 0.

Operational specification:
- Startup order must satisfy inbound dependency readiness before serving or consuming traffic.
- Shutdown order must drain in-flight work where possible and close external connections cleanly.
- Configuration must be environment-driven, with explicit defaults only where safe for local development.
- Security controls must enforce least privilege for tokens, credentials, and network paths crossing boundaries.

Rebuild procedure for this node:
1. Recreate containment location and parent relationship in the topology graph.
2. Re-establish all inbound and outbound edge contracts, including protocol and layer7 semantics.
3. Restore concern-matrix linked documents and skills before enabling write paths.
4. Validate behavior against node-specific feature expectations and shared integration contracts.
5. Record evidence of successful startup, interface validation, and failure recovery checks.
