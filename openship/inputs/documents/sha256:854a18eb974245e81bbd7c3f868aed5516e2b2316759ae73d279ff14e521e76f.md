StaffX is an architecture-centric collaboration platform that combines project and thread lifecycle management with AI-assisted system evolution. The active runtime includes desktop and web clients, a Fastify API, PostgreSQL persistence, identity providers, external documentation integrations, and reusable shared packages. System behavior is thread-centric: each thread references a seed system snapshot, actions can fork and mutate system state, and OpenShip bundles can be generated or reconciled as file-based architecture artifacts.
