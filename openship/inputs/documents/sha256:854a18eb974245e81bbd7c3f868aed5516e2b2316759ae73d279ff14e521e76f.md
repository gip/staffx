title: System Overview (Active Runtime)
language: en
---

This overview describes the active runtime architecture as a multi-host, multi-process system with shared library dependencies and an OpenShip-backed architecture state model.

System composition:
- User-facing clients run as a browser web client process and a desktop renderer process.
- Desktop includes a main process for authentication integration, local orchestration, and IPC bridging.
- API service is the central orchestration boundary for project lifecycle, thread lifecycle, assistant runs, integrations, events, and OpenShip synchronization.
- PostgreSQL provides transactional persistence for identity, projects, topology, documents, matrix references, artifacts, collaboration settings, assistant runs, and events.
- Third-party identity and content boundaries include Auth0, Google OAuth and Google Docs APIs, and Notion APIs.
- Shared library nodes provide UI composition and agent runtime utilities reused across host processes.

System behavior model:
- Clients authenticate, call API endpoints, and react to event streams for near-real-time state updates.
- API reads and writes canonical project/thread/system records, enforces authorization and validation, publishes events, and handles OpenShip bundle reconcile flows.
- Assistant run lifecycle is queue-driven with claim, complete, and cancel transitions; completion can reconcile architecture artifacts and chat outputs.
- Integrations use OAuth state exchange and token lifecycle management with status and disconnect controls.

Rebuild outcomes expected from this overview:
1. Reconstruct the same node inventory and parent-child containment relationships.
2. Reconstruct connectivity edges with matching protocol and layer7 semantics.
3. Restore API and eventing behavior with equivalent contracts and side effects.
4. Restore persistence model and migration order compatible with runtime write patterns.
5. Verify the rebuilt system supports both web and desktop operating modes.
