# Collaboration, Roles, and Concerns

## Purpose
Coordinate multi-user editing rights and role-scoped responsibilities inside a project.

## Capabilities
- Add and remove collaborators with Editor or Viewer access role.
- Assign custom project roles to collaborators and owner.
- Add and remove project concerns tied to OpenShip matrix dimensions.
- Protect concern and role deletion when still referenced.

## Workflow
- Owner creates role catalog entries in project_roles.
- Owner assigns roles through project_member_roles.
- Concerns are written into the current project system concern registry.
- Concern deletion checks matrix_refs and artifacts usage counts before allowing removal.

## Data touched
- project_collaborators
- project_roles
- project_member_roles
- concerns
- matrix_refs
- artifacts

## Failure modes
- Duplicate collaborator or duplicate role insertion returns conflict.
- Invalid role assignment rejects request with validation error.
- Deleting assigned roles or referenced concerns returns conflict.
