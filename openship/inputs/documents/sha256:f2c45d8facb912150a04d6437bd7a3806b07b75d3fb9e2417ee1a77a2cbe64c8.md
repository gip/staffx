title: "API Functional Testing Coverage Expectations"

---

Functional verification for the API process must cover auth token verification, project and thread access rules, collaborator role gates, concern and role integrity constraints, assistant run queue transitions, OpenShip bundle generation and reconciliation, and event cursor continuity. Testing should include both success and failure scenarios: invalid UUIDs, missing required body values, duplicate entries, conflicting role deletion, stale OAuth states, and run completion race handling. Regression checks should assert that all active /v1 endpoints remain documented and reachable according to current bootstrap registration.
