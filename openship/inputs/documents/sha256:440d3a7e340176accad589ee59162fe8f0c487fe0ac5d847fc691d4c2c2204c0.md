StaffX supports local and hosted deployment topologies. Web is built as a SPA and can be deployed on static hosting with rewrite-to-index behavior. API is a Node.js Fastify service exposing /v1 routes and optional background runner polling. Desktop is packaged with Electron and communicates with the same API. PostgreSQL hosts all durable state. Third-party identity and integration services run outside first-party trust boundaries. Environment separation should isolate development, preview, and production credentials, particularly for Auth0 audience/domain and integration client secrets.
