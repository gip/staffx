# Implementation and Build Architecture

## Workspace layout
- apps/api, apps/web, and apps/desktop provide deployable runtime targets.
- packages/ui and packages/agent-runtime provide reusable shared functionality.
- TypeScript base config is shared from tsconfig.base.json.

## Build and run model
- API uses tsx watch for development and tsc for build output.
- Web uses Vite and TypeScript noEmit check.
- Desktop uses electron-vite with separated main, preload, and renderer build outputs.
- Workspace scripts orchestrate combined development and build flows.

## Client implementation model
- Shared UI package exports pages and domain types used by both web and desktop renderer.
- Desktop renderer mirrors web route composition with desktop-specific auth plumbing.
- Desktop main process owns browser window lifecycle, authentication IPC, and local run trigger IPC.

## Assistant runtime model
- agent-runtime selects provider model route and normalizes output summaries.
- OpenShip snapshot and diff utilities map file-level changes into structured run change records.
