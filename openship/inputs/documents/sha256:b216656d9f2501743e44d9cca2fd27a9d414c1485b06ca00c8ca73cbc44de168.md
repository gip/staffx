# Node Specification for p.api

## Responsibility
Fastify API process implemented in apps/api/src. It provides v1 contracts, access control, project and thread lifecycle logic, assistant run queue orchestration, OpenShip export and reconciliation, integrations, and events.

## Interfaces
- Consumes and produces data contracts through documented edges and concerns.
- Participates in feature workflows listed in the feature index and mapped concern matrix.

## Dependencies
- Runtime dependencies and external protocols are documented in connectivity and implementation concerns.
- Data dependencies are documented in data model concerns where applicable.

## Failure and recovery notes
- Operational failure in this node is surfaced to dependent nodes through contract-level error behaviors.
- Rebuild verification requires this node to satisfy connectivity, security, and deployment assumptions in the related documents.

## Source traceability
- Primary implementation references are documented in architecture and implementation documents and linked source path lists.
