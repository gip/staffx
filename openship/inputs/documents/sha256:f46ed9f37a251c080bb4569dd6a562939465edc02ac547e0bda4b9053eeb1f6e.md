The database schema models immutable system snapshots and collaborative thread evolution. Core OpenShip entities include systems, concerns, nodes, edges, documents, matrix refs, artifacts, and artifact files. Collaboration entities include projects, collaborators, roles, threads, actions, messages, and changes. Operational entities include agent run queue state, integration OAuth state, user integration tokens, and ordered event logs. Functions such as fork_system, begin_action, and thread_current_system maintain snapshot lineage and action-driven state progression.
