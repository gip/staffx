Identity and integration flows follow provider-scoped state machines. Auth0 bearer verification gates all protected APIs. Provider authorization endpoints create integration_oauth_states rows with expiration and return-to sanitization. Callback handlers validate provider and state, exchange codes for tokens, encrypt token payloads, and update user_integrations status. Google document imports parse docs URLs, fetch document content, convert rich content to plain text, and preserve metadata such as revision IDs. Notion imports normalize page identifiers, fetch page and block content, and map text plus metadata for local document creation. Disconnect flow revokes provider tokens best-effort and marks local integration state disconnected.
