title: Specs - ui Shared UI Library
language: en
---

This technical specification defines rebuild-critical implementation constraints for @staffx/ui Shared UI Library. The intent is to allow a new team to recreate equivalent runtime behavior from documents alone.

Node identity and boundary:
- Node ID: l.ui.
- Kind: Library.
- Parent: none.
- Ownership model: first_party.
- Trust boundary: internal.
- Metadata language: typescript-react.

Interface and connectivity contract:
- Inbound dependency count: 2.
- Outbound dependency count: 0.
- Inbound contracts:
  Dependency flow from Web Client Process using transport unspecified protocol and application semantics unspecified application protocol.
  Dependency flow from Desktop Renderer Process using transport unspecified protocol and application semantics unspecified application protocol.

Operational specification:
- Startup order must satisfy inbound dependency readiness before serving or consuming traffic.
- Shutdown order must drain in-flight work where possible and close external connections cleanly.
- Configuration must be environment-driven, with explicit defaults only where safe for local development.
- Security controls must enforce least privilege for tokens, credentials, and network paths crossing boundaries.

Rebuild procedure for this node:
1. Recreate containment location and parent relationship in the topology graph.
2. Re-establish all inbound and outbound edge contracts, including protocol and layer7 semantics.
3. Restore concern-matrix linked documents and skills before enabling write paths.
4. Validate behavior against node-specific feature expectations and shared integration contracts.
5. Record evidence of successful startup, interface validation, and failure recovery checks.
