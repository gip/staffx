Desktop runtime packaging is built with electron-vite and executes on end-user machines. It hosts one privileged main process and one unprivileged renderer process with context isolation enabled. Rebuild requirements include Electron build tooling, Auth0 desktop callback handling, and API connectivity to the v1 backend.
