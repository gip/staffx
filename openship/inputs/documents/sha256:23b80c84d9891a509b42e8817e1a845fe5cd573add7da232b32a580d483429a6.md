# Node Specification for s.root

## Responsibility
Root system node representing the StaffX product boundary. It anchors all hosts, processes, and library dependencies. It carries global feature, architecture, security, implementation, and deployment references used to rebuild the full system.

## Interfaces
- Consumes and produces data contracts through documented edges and concerns.
- Participates in feature workflows listed in the feature index and mapped concern matrix.

## Dependencies
- Runtime dependencies and external protocols are documented in connectivity and implementation concerns.
- Data dependencies are documented in data model concerns where applicable.

## Failure and recovery notes
- Operational failure in this node is surfaced to dependent nodes through contract-level error behaviors.
- Rebuild verification requires this node to satisfy connectivity, security, and deployment assumptions in the related documents.

## Source traceability
- Primary implementation references are documented in architecture and implementation documents and linked source path lists.
