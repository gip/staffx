# Project Lifecycle Management

## Purpose
Provide durable workspace boundaries for architecture and thread collaboration.

## Capabilities
- Project creation with owner-scoped name uniqueness.
- Name availability pre-check endpoint.
- Description and visibility updates with role-based authorization.
- Archive operation to hide projects from active listings while preserving data history.

## Workflow
- Creation bootstraps project row, initial OpenShip system row, root node, and first thread.
- List endpoints return access role, visibility, and bounded thread preview for navigation.
- Settings route resolves role and concern catalogs from current project system.

## Permissions
- Owner controls archive, visibility, collaborator, role, and concern administration.
- Owner and Editor can update project description.
- Public visibility allows read access for unaffiliated users.

## Data touched
- projects, threads, systems, nodes, concerns, project_roles, project_member_roles, project_collaborators.

## Failure modes
- Invalid project naming format rejected.
- Duplicate project names per owner rejected.
- Missing project or insufficient role returns forbidden or not found responses.
